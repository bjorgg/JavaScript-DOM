# JavaScript In The Browser - DOM Manipulation & Timing

This was a school project exercising DOM manipulation & timing.

I created a shopping list, you can add items by writing in the input
field and clicking add. You can click on items and they get a check
mark and a line through and toggles back when clicked again. You can
click on the "x" to remove corresponding item from the list. You can
also click on the "Clear list" button and clear all items from the list
and when you do so a loading bar displays for a couple of seconds using
setTimeout. I also display a clock on the screen using setInterval.

You can find comments in the JavaScript code for further information.
